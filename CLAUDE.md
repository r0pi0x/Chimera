# CLAUDE.md

Lucker Party (public monorepo; its engine is **Chimera**, `chimera/`;
"mashup" is the old name of the whole and of the dev sandbox): minigames
built from other games' assets and behavior, with parts mixed across games
(e.g. a Combat Arms character on a Counter-Strike: Source map), and later
original minigames. Layers: Chimera, loaders (`source/`), games as
libraries (`games/`), apps (`apps/`). Planned layout:
[docs/plans/active/engine-split.md](docs/plans/active/engine-split.md).

This file is a map. Follow the links for detail; keep it short.

## Hard rules

- Never commit other games' assets, extracted files or encryption keys. Load
  assets at runtime from the user's own install.
- Third-party code never enters this repo and is never translated line by
  line. Behavior reaches us only as specs in our own words, written in a
  separate session. Implementation sessions read specs only.
- Bevy is pinned in `Cargo.toml` (0.20.0) and its API changes often: check the
  pinned crate source in `~/.cargo/registry/src/*/bevy_*-0.20.0/` or its
  examples instead of memory. Same for avian3d (0.8).
- Must build and run on Linux and Windows.
- Scope: first-person games only; CS:S and Combat Arms first.

`cargo test` enforces layering, the asset rule, the spec rule and this file's
links (`checks/tests/it/architecture.rs`). Its failure messages say how to fix things.

```

Each crate's integration tests are one binary, `<crate>/tests/it/` (slow
ones in `tests/it/heavy/`), in the lowest crate whose API they need;
scenario tests run on Chimera's `harness::Sim` with their layer's base
(`SimBasePlugins` in Chimera, `CsSim` in cs_source); docs/OBSERVABILITY.md
section 1 says where new ones go. `tools/post-push-tests.sh` runs the
affected crates' tests (`CHIMERA_PUSH_TESTS=all`: everything, `=0`: none).
Environment variables are `CHIMERA_*` and the local config
`chimera.local.toml`; the old names (`MASHUP_*`, `mashup.local.toml`)
still work.

## Working conventions

- Verify your own work with tests, screenshots or remote queries
  (docs/OBSERVABILITY.md) before calling it done. New behavior gets a
  scenario test.
- Commit at working milestones: `.githooks/pre-commit` checks the
  affected crates' tests and runs the changed crates' fast tier;
  `pre-push` checks identity and `repo_checks` only (enable per clone:
  `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`). Push first, test after: run
  `tools/post-push-tests.sh` right after each push (affected tests, heavy
  too; one-line result in `.claude/post-push/last.txt`) and fix a FAIL
  at once.
- Propose a plan before writing a new mount adapter or loader. Multi-session
  work gets a plan in `docs/plans/active/`, kept updated.
- When something was hard because a tool, doc or check was missing, add it.
- Keep docs true: when code changes a fact in a doc, change the doc in the
  same commit. A file's detail lives in its `//!` doc (shortcuts under
  "Known shortcuts"); docs/modules.md and the code part of tech-debt.md are
  generated from those docs: after changing one, run
  `cargo run -q -p repo_checks --bin docs_index` (a test fails when stale).

## Commit identity

Commits are by `r0pi0x <339403489+r0pi0x@users.noreply.github.com>` with
UTC dates: set that identity in the clone's local git config and commit
with `TZ=UTC`. `.githooks/pre-push` refuses anything else. No real names,
personal emails or machine paths in commits or files.

## Testing on Windows

Remote: https://github.com/r0pi0x/Chimera (public; renamed from
LuckerParty on 2026-10-16, the old URL redirects). The games and the
spec reference material live on the Windows PC, which has its own checkout
(`git clone https://github.com/r0pi0x/Chimera`); `scripts\playtest.ps1`
pulls and runs an optimized build. Spec sessions there write into `specs/`
in that checkout and push; implementation sessions pull them.
